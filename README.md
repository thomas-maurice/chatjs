# chatjs
Some random dummy websocket chat application to toy around node and the automated building tools

## Build
To build it you need the following :
 * node.js
 * npm
 * bower (install with `sudo npm install -g bower`)
 * grunt (install with `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`)

Then run the following commands to build the app:

    npm install
		bower install
		grunt

And it should do it !

## Running
Before that I have to code the app
